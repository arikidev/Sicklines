This is a repository for a BepInEx plugin for *Bomb Rush Cyberfunk*. It allows you to create and complete custom Combolines.

## Usage
The mod should automatically send you a notification in your phone messages to explain how to use the mod.

#Create Lines
1. You can use the app to start a custom path. It will record your path until you drop you combo.
2. You can either test the line by interaction with the hologram disk or use the call button to create an Ai to follow your path. *Note AI are dumb and will often fail
3. You can either Save the current line or choose to create a new one.
4. Your current active line will be orange. Once you save it will become green.

# Completing Lines
1. If you create or load a Line you can start an encounter
2. You will need to follow the path by reading the markers
3. You are required to complete any trick/grinds/boosts ect as shown in the path.
4. Once you reach the end it will complete the line. Completions are automatically saved. Complete line will turn grey.

# Adding/ Sharing SickLines
This mod allows you to save a .path file to share your lines with others. 
1. You can choose to save your current Line through the app. If you do it will be saved in the config folder.
2. Navigate to your BepInEx installation for the game and open the `BepInEx/config/Sicklines/` folder
3. You can add or remove .path files from this directory
